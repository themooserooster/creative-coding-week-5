Project Repo for Creative Coding Class - Week 5

This week's topic:

Putting it all together with the Create JS Library!

CreateJs is a graphics and interactivity library. It's open source and actively
contributed to by the likes of Adobe and Microsoft. Its heavily inspired by how
Flash's DisplayList API was designed.
